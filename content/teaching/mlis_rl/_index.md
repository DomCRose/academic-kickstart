These pages collect the notes, exercises, example code and video lectures for the reinforcement learning (RL) content covered in the Machine Learning in Science (MLiS) 1 and 2 modules at the University of Nottingham.

Here we aim to introduce the general problems to which RL is applied, and the approach adopted by RL techniques to solve them. To do this concisely, in the MLiS1 module we focused on a deterministic setting, using a random walker problem as a recurring example. Despite being much more specific than the fully probabilistic setting, this still allows the motivation of many of the standard components that make up RL techniques: bootstrapping, Monte-Carlo and function approximation.

The last part of the course, part of the MLiS2 module, briefly generalizes to the probabilistic setting by introducing Markov Decision Processes, before using this more general formulation to introduce policy gradient techniques. Finally, we discuss the use of deep neural networks in RL, along with mentioning a few specific recent developments such as deterministic policy gradients and maximum-entropy RL.

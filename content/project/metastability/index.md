In this project, leading on from [foundational work](https://doi-org.ezproxy.nottingham.ac.uk/10.1103/PhysRevLett.116.240404) [(ArXiv)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.05801) on metastability in open quantum systems, we apply this theory to a variety of models, further developing this theory in the process.

  abstract  = {We apply a recently developed theory for metastability in open quantum systems to a one-dimensional dissipative quantum Ising model. Earlier results suggest this model features either a nonequilibrium phase transition or a smooth but sharp crossover, where the stationary state changes from paramagnetic to ferromagnetic, accompanied by strongly intermittent emission dynamics characteristic of first-order coexistence between dynamical phases. We show that for a range of parameters close to this transition or crossover point the dynamics of the finite system displays pronounced metastability, i.e., the system relaxes first to long-lived metastable states before eventual relaxation to the true stationary state. From the spectral properties of the quantum master operator we characterize the low-dimensional manifold of metastable states, which are shown to be probability mixtures of two, paramagnetic and ferromagnetic, metastable phases. We also show that for long times the dynamics can be approximated by a classical stochastic dynamics between the metastable phases that is directly related to the intermittent dynamics observed in quantum trajectories and thus the dynamical phases.},

  abstract  = {We study an ensemble of strongly coupled electrons under continuous microwave irradiation interacting with a dissipative environment, a problem of relevance to the creation of highly polarized nonequilibrium states in nuclear magnetic resonance. We analyze the stationary states of the dynamics, described within a Lindblad master equation framework, at the mean-field approximation level. This approach allows us to identify steady-state phase transitions between phases of high and low polarization controlled by the distribution of disordered electronic interactions. We compare the mean-field predictions to numerically exact simulations of small systems and find good agreement. Our study highlights the possibility of observing collective phenomena, such as metastable states, phase transitions, and critical behavior, in appropriately designed paramagnetic systems. These phenomena occur in a low-temperature regime which is not theoretically tractable by conventional methods, e.g., the spin-temperature approach.},

  abstract  = {We study the spectral properties of classical and quantum Markovian processes that are reset at random times to a specific configuration or state with a reset rate that is independent of the current state of the system. We demonstrate that this simple reset dynamics causes a uniform shift in the eigenvalues of the Markov generator, excluding the zero mode corresponding to the stationary state, which has the effect of accelerating or even inducing relaxation to a stationary state. Based on this result, we provide expressions for the stationary state and probability current of the reset process in terms of weighted sums over dynamical modes of the reset-free process. We also discuss the effect of resets on processes that display metastability. We illustrate our results with two classical stochastic processes, the totally asymmetric random walk and the one-dimensional Brownian motion, as well as two quantum models: a particle coherently hopping on a chain and the dissipative transverse field Ising model, known to exhibit metastability.},

  abstract      = {Tensor network (TN) techniques - often used in the context of quantum many-body physics - have shown promise as a tool for tackling machine learning (ML) problems. The application of TNs to ML, however, has mostly focused on supervised and unsupervised learning. Yet, with their direct connection to hidden Markov chains, TNs are also naturally suited to Markov decision processes (MDPs) which provide the foundation for reinforcement learning (RL). Here we introduce a general TN formulation of finite, episodic and discrete MDPs. We show how this formulation allows us to exploit algorithms developed for TNs for policy optimisation, the key aim of RL. As an application we consider the issue - formulated as an RL problem - of finding a stochastic evolution that satisfies specific dynamical conditions, using the simple example of random walk excursions as an illustration.},

  title         = {A reinforcement learning approach to rare trajectory sampling},
  year          = {2020},
  abstract      = {Very often when studying non-equilibrium systems one is interested in analysing dynamical behaviour that occurs with very low probability, so called rare events. In practice, since rare events are by definition atypical, they are often difficult to access in a statistically significant way. What are required are strategies to "make rare events typical" so that they can be generated on demand. Here we present such a general approach to adaptively construct a dynamics that efficiently samples atypical events. We do so by exploiting the methods of reinforcement learning (RL), which refers to the set of machine learning techniques aimed at finding the optimal behaviour to maximise a reward associated with the dynamics. We consider the general perspective of dynamical trajectory ensembles, whereby rare events are described in terms of ensemble reweighting. By minimising the distance between a reweighted ensemble and that of a suitably parametrised controlled dynamics we arrive at a set of methods similar to those of RL to numerically approximate the optimal dynamics that realises the rare behaviour of interest. As simple illustrations we consider in detail the problem of excursions of a random walker, for the case of rare events with a finite time horizon; and the problem of a studying current statistics of a particle hopping in a ring geometry, for the case of an infinite time horizon. We discuss natural extensions of the ideas presented here, including to continuous-time Markov systems, first passage time problems and non-Markovian dynamics.},

  year          = {2020},
  abstract      = {We present a general theory of classical metastability in open quantum systems. Metastability is a consequence of a large separation in timescales in the dynamics, leading to the existence of a regime when states of the system appear stationary, before eventual relaxation towards a true stationary state at much larger times. In this work, we focus on the emergence of classical metastability, i.e., when metastable states of an open quantum system with separation of timescales can be approximated as probabilistic mixtures of a finite number of states. We find that a number of classical features follow from this approximation, for both the manifold of metastable states and long-time dynamics between them. Namely, those states are approximately disjoint and thus play the role of metastable phases, and the relaxation towards the stationary state is approximated by a classical stochastic dynamics between them. Importantly, the classical dynamics is observed not only on average, but also at the level of individual quantum trajectories: we show that time coarse-grained continuous measurement records can be viewed as noisy classical trajectories, while their statistics can be approximated by that of the classical dynamics. Among others, this explains how first-order dynamical phase transitions arise from metastability. Finally, in order to verify the presence of classical metastability in a given open quantum system, we develop an efficient numerical approach that delivers the set of metastable phases together with the effective classical dynamics. Since the proximity to a first-order dissipative phase transition manifests as metastability, the theory and tools introduced in this work can be used to investigate such transitions - which occur in the large size limit - through the metastable behavior of many-body systems of moderate sizes accessible to numerics.},
